# Snake-game
Snake-game is a grid-based game I coded by myself. In this game you have to catch an apple with a snake you are able to control
with the arrow keys.

## Try it out

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/m1rels/snake-game
   ```

2. In VS Code go to index.html, right-click and choose "Open with Live Server". You should see the game popping up in your browser.
